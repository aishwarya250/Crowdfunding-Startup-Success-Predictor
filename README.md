# Startup Assessment Web Application

Our objective is to help Redcrow (vendor for whom prototype was built) utilize predictive models to assess the success or failure of startup. We have built a Minimum Viable Project which is a web application built in Flask and deployed with docker on AWS EC2 instance.  The idea is to take as input the feature values for the startup company under assessment and predict the success probability on logistic regression model in the background. We also provide a dashboard that visualizes the data, business insights and feature importance on top of which the model was derived. 

The data for this project is taken from,

### About

The main aim of the project was to give the probability of success of the startup. we found the companies within the last decade which had raised more than one round of funding. Status of the company which includes IPO, Acquired, Closed, Operating was changed to success and failure. After tunning the logistic regression model, the model was deployed on a flask application which was dockerized and hosted on AWS EC2 instance. With the thousands of companies from different domains, we considered only Healthcare industries as our area of focus was the healthcare domain. we considered the following features for the prediction,

1) Total Funding (USD)
2) Funding Rounds
3) Time Between First Round
4) Avg Raised USD
5) Avg Time Between Rounds
6) Investor Counts
7) Type of Industry (with Healthcare domain)
8) Regions (In USA)
9) Homepage URL (existing or not)

We applied various classification algorithms, and we found that tree-based models like XGBoost as well as Logistic Regression performed the best.

Due to its interpretability and ability to quantitatively translate the inputs to the output, we deployed the Logistic Regression model. The parameters which compared different models were accuracy, AUC and f-beta score . In the fbeta score the extra emphasis was on recall because in the application of venture capital investments (the intended use case for this model), it is far more important to catch any potential "unicorns" even at the expense of investing in a few "duds".

The entire workflow is shown below,

### Install

This project requires **Python 3** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [Logistic Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html)
- [Support Vector Machine](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html)
- [xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Random Forrest](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html)
- [Pickel](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.org/)
- [nltk](https://nltk.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

Make sure you have [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) installed.

You could just install [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 

Also, you need to have an account on Amazon Web Service [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) so that you can host on EC2.

### Files

There are two main notebooks, one is the cleaning notebook, where the data is cleaned and prepared for modeling and the other is the modeling notebook where the ML models and the model performance are compared,

```bash
Data_Cleaning.ipynb
```  
and
```bash
Data_Modelling.ipynb
```
Web app folder contains the flask application and the Docker folder contain the docker file and requirements.txt file.

### Results 
Here is the web application which takes the parameter and tells us the prediction probability and the factors on which it calculates is shown in the dashboard.
